## fHDHR

Under `fhdhr`, you'll find 2 addresses listed. `0.0.0.0` works great for a listen address, however, it seems that SSDP works best if the discovery address is set to the IP to say that there is a service at.

````
[fhdhr]
# address = 0.0.0.0
# port = 5004
# discovery_address = 0.0.0.0
````

## template

template requires signin credentials, so add those.

````
[template]
# username =
# password =
